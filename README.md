# A Rewards Engine

A simple and serverless rewards system thats easy to implement and use!

This system used AWS Lambda and AWS DynamobDB, so if you want to use this you'll need your AWS Credentials. Because this system works with the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) you could implement the code with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM OpenWhisk, etc.
